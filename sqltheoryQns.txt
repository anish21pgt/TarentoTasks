Practical applications of joins in sql

-> Self join in the real world is when we have a table with Employee data and each row contains information about employee and his/her manager. You can use self join in this scenario and retrieve relevant information.

-> Inner join application example is, information of a person scattered across two tables namely EmpDetails and MaritalStatus.EmpDetails table holds details EmpID, Name and Salary And the MaritalStatus table holds the details EmpID, Age, Status



Normalization and its types

Normalization is used in datbase to remove redundancy. It basically means to bring the database to its normal form.

Types of normalization are,

1NF: This is the First Normal Form in which a relation contains an atomic value. 
2NF: The second normal form used for the normalization process. A relation in 2NF must be in 1NF, and all the non-key attributes depend on the primary key in the Second Normal Form. 
3NF: It stands for Third Normal Form, wherein if a relation is in 3NF, it must be in 2NF, and there should be no transition dependency. 
BCNF: BCNF stands for Boyce-Codd Normal Form, which is stronger than 3NF.
4NF: This is the Fourth Normal Form which doesn’t contain any value dependency. A relation that is in 4NF also comes in BCNF. 
5NF: 5NF stands for Fifth Normal Form, where the relationship should be in 4NF to apply the fifth normal form. This normal form doesn’t contain any dependency. 
6NF: It stands for Sixth Normal Form, which is not a standardized form of normalization. Therefore it isn’t used nowadays and may give a clear and standardized normalization in the future.
